# FNBot

FNBot is a simple to run Fortnite bot that can show all cosmetics you like. It is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

NOTE: I'm not actively maintaining the bot since I don't have time for that, so don't expect me to respond fast or to fix issues that could occur.

## Support me
If you want to support me, feel free to by using my Support-a-Creator code `lthazzz` in Fortnite :).
Every purchase counts and allows me to keep my projects up.

## Discord

You can contact me at Discord, just send a friend request to `vinzy#7174`.

## Features

- Set the bots cosmetics to everything you want by simply providing the cosmetics name or ID.
- Up to 15 people can join the bots lobby.
- Multiple languages supported:
  - You can provide cosmetic names in many different languages (all that Fortnite has at the moment).
  - Bot messages, console texts, etc. can be shown in Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, and Romanian.
- Very simple installation (no need to install Node.js, you can just use the binaries).
